Description: SimSeq is a package that creates a simulated RNA-Seq dataset with a known set of differentially expressed (DE) genes and equivalently expressed (EE) genes. This simulation assumes no underlying statistical model, but rather is based on a provided matrix of real gene expression data with large sample sizes in each treatment group. Such a simulation is useful to evaluate statistical methodology for RNA-Seq in that false discovery proportions (FDP's) are known exactly due to knowledge of which genes are simulated to be DE and which are simulated to be EE.
