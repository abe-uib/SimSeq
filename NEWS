2013-09-07: SimSeq Version 0.4.0
	- Changed version names of all files from 1.x.y to 0.x.y 
	- removed pval.hist function
	- now calculates weights for sampling genes by local fdr through fdrtool function from CRAN package 'fdrtool'
	- changed name of EBP input in SimData function to weights
	- updated examples for SimData
	- updated documentation of functions
	- removed package 'edgeR' from Depends field in description file
	- added package 'edgeR' and 'fdrtool' to Suggests field in description file

2013-08-29: SimSeq Version 1.3.0
	-Moved wilcox signed rank and rank sum test out of SimData function to its own function, CalcPvalWilcox
	-Changed default for offsets to calcNormFactors from package 'edgeR' using method "TMM"
	-created dependency on package 'edgeR'
	-Changed independence swapping code (changed method for adjusting data by offsets, eliminated for-loops)
	-set samp.independent default to FALSE
	-minimal cleaning up of help/documentation files (still needs a bit of work)
	-created CalcPvalWilcox .Rd file

2013-08-24: SimSeq Version 1.2
	-substantially cleaned up code for readability and maintainability
	-added more detailed comments to code
	-Renamed data.sim and sortdata functions to SimData and SortData respectively
	-Added samp.genes functions
	-fixed errors in offset under the independent method section
SB


2013-08-19: SimSeq Version 1.1
	-Added symmetric swap functionality to data.sim function
	-Added checks on initial parameters submitted to data.sim function
	-help files are no longer working
SB

2013-08-17: SimSeq Version 1.0
	- Created sortdata, samp.col, and data.sim functions
	- sortdata: sorts matrix of gene express. data given vector of replicates and treatment
	- samp.col: samples replicates by columns separately and independently
	- data.sim: Now has functionality to simulate under both standard and independent method for both paired and unpaired data
